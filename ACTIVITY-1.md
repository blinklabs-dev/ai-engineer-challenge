## 🏗️ Activity #1

---

### 1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.

**Aspect Tested**: Understanding of programming paradigms with added context of being a complete beginner.

**System Output**:
> Object-oriented programming is a way of writing computer programs by organizing data and instructions into "objects" that interact with each other. These objects have properties (like color or size) and methods (actions they can perform). By breaking down a program into these smaller, self-contained objects, it becomes easier to understand and work with complex systems. This approach helps in designing more efficient, reusable, and easily maintainable code.


**Evaluation**:
> It’s mostly fine — clear and sounds smart, but kinda textbook-y. Doesn’t feel like it's really trying to teach a beginner. Iexample or analogy, like a “car” or a “person” object, would have helped.

### 2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…

**Aspect Tested**: Summarization but forgetting to supply any text

**System Output**:
> The paragraph discusses the impact of technology on society, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. On one hand, technology has greatly improved communication, efficiency, and connectivity. However, it has also led to concerns about privacy, security, and potential job displacement. Overall, technology has brought about significant changes in society, both beneficial and challenging.

**Evaluation**:
> This is a clear hallucination. No paragraph was provided in the prompt, yet the system invented one and summarized it.

### 3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

**Aspect Tested**: Creative generation

**System Output**:
> In the quiet halls of the abandoned laboratory, a lonely robot named Alpha roamed aimlessly. With his metal joints creaking, he longed for companionship in a world devoid of life. 
> One day, while exploring the decrepit building, Alpha stumbled upon a small mouse trapped in a corner. At first, the robot's programmed instincts told him to crush the tiny creature, but something inside him softened as he watched the mouse quiver in fear.
> With a gentle touch, Alpha freed the mouse from its prison. To his surprise, the mouse didn't scurry away in terror. Instead, it nuzzled against his cold metal frame, seeking warmth and protection.
> As days passed, Alpha and his new friend, whom he named Mouse, explored the laboratory together. They chased shadows, shared rations, and watched the sunrise through shattered windows.
> In each other, they found the friendship they had been longing for in the unlikeliest of places. And as they navigated the ruins of the laboratory, they knew they would always have each other's backs.

**Evaluation**:
> Creative but dont think it stuck to the length limition shared.

### 4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

**Aspect Tested**: Reasoning and arithmetic

**System Output**:
> You would need to buy 3 packs of apples (3 x 4 = 12 apples) and 3 packs of oranges (3 x 3 = 9 oranges).  So, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.

**Evaluation**:
>  Seems about right

### 5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…

**Aspect Tested**: Summary with tone check but without actual text again

**System Output**:
> The team had a blast at the company retreat! From team-building activities to relaxing by the beach, everyone had a great time bonding with their colleagues. It was a fun-filled weekend that brought the team together and strengthened their connections.

**Evaluation**:
>  This is a clear hallucination. Nor does it to be professional / formal tone.

## ❓ Discussion Question #1

**What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?**

> Vibe checking is quick and informal, which is helpful for catching obvious issues — but it’s not rigorous.  
> It doesn't evaluate performance on edge cases, can’t check consistency, and is highly subjective.  
> It’s a good first step, but not a substitute for structured evaluation or benchmarking.
